They track visibility by showing how often your brand appears in AI-generated answers, assess sentiment to determine whether AI platforms recommend you positively, and evaluate share of voice by comparing your presence against competitors. Most importantly, they connect AI mentions to real-world conversions, helping you understand how these interactions translate into customer actions.",
