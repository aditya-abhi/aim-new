    question: "What’s the difference between SEO and AEO tools?",
    answer:
      "SEO tools optimize for rankings on traditional search results (blue links).AEO tools track and optimize for AI-generated answers (Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity). They don’t just measure keywords; they measure brand mentions, prompt volume, and AI visibility.",

  {
    id: 2,
    question: "Why do I need AEO tools if I already use SEMrush/Ahrefs?",
    answer:
      "Platforms like SEMrush and Ahrefs excel at tracking keyword rankings, but they lack visibility into AI-generated answers. That’s where AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) tools come in. They reveal whether your brand appears in AI-generated responses, how frequently competitors are recommended instead of you, and the overall sentiment expressed in those AI answers. Without AEO, you’re only seeing half the picture.",

    question: "Which AEO tool is best for small businesses?",
    answer:
      "For SMBs and startups, AI Monitor and Otterly.AI are the best fits. They’re budget-friendly, easy to use, and focused on ROI, helping smaller teams track visibility in AI without enterprise-level complexity.",

  {
    id: 4,
    question: "How do AEO tools measure success?",
    answer:
      "AEO tools measure success across several key dimensions. They track visibility by showing how often your brand appears in AI-generated answers, assess sentiment to determine whether AI platforms recommend you positively, and evaluate share of voice by comparing your presence against competitors. Most importantly, they connect AI mentions to real-world conversions, helping you understand how these interactions translate into customer actions.",

    question:
      "Can’t I just optimize for Google’s AI Overviews and ignore other platforms?",
    answer:
      "No. While Google AI Overviews dominate search, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude are rapidly becoming discovery engines. Gen Z often starts directly in AI chatbots meaning ignoring multi-platform AEO means losing entire audiences.",

    question: "Are AEO tools just repackaged SEO tools?",
    answer:
      "No. Legacy SEO tools weren’t built for AI-native environments.AEO platforms measure things like LLM prompts, AI mentions, and multi-model visibility data SEO tools can’t track.",

    question: "How much do AEO tools cost?",
    answer:
      "Pricing for AEO tools varies widely depending on scale and functionality. Entry-level platforms like Otterly.AI typically range from $39 to $99 per month. Mid-market options such as AI Monitor and RankScale are more affordable, starting around $19 per month. For enterprise-grade solutions like Profound and BrandRank.ai, pricing can climb significantly, often ranging from $500 to over $2,000 per month",

    question: "What’s the #1 mistake brands make with AEO?",
    answer:
      "The biggest mistake is treating AEO like SEO. Brands focus only on keywords and rankings, instead of optimizing entity data, brand authority, and answer readiness across multiple AI platforms. This leads to competitors dominating AI answers even if you outrank them in Google Search.",
