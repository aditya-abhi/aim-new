                    SurveyMonkey’s U.S.-centric approach wasn’t working
                    globally. Their site lacked local optimization, translations
                    missed intent, and content wasn’t built for AI-driven
                    platforms like ChatGPT and Google AI Overviews. Competitors
                    were capturing high-intent users, slowing growth and

                <h2 className="h4 xl:h3 mt-4 mb-2 xl:mb-3">The Problem</h2>
                <p>
                  SurveyMonkey had long depended on its brand reputation to
                  drive organic growth, especially in English-speaking markets.
                  But, honestly, that approach hit a ceiling when it came to
                  regions like Germany, Brazil, and Japan. The growth team ran
                  into three main problems:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>First,</strong> <br />
                    their technical infrastructure just wasn’t dialed in for
                    local search engines. Even with demand in places like Brazil
                    and Japan, SurveyMonkey’s pages weren’t showing up where
                    they mattered. There was a clear disconnect between what
                    local users wanted and what SurveyMonkey was offering, at
                    least in the eyes of those search algorithms.
                  </li>
                  <li className="mt-1">
                    <strong>Second,</strong> <br />
                    language and intent were tripping them up. A straight-up
                    translation of “free survey tool” didn’t resonate with how
                    German or French users actually search. Meanwhile, local
                    competitors, who really understood the regional context,
                    were pulling in all the organic traffic.
                  </li>
                  <li className="mt-1">
                    <strong>Third,</strong> <br />
                    And then came the wave of AI-driven discovery. With users
                    switching to conversational platforms like ChatGPT or
                    relying on Google’s AI-powered summaries, SurveyMonkey’s
                    legacy content was falling behind. People want direct,
                    concise answers, not a copy-paste of the old FAQ.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p className="">
                  Recognizing all this, the growth team knew they needed a new
                  approach. They had to find a partner with deep expertise in
                  the evolving search landscape, someone who could help them
                  move beyond keywords and links to a strategy focused on user
                  intent and establishing a truly global presence. The days of
                  relying solely on brand strength were over; it was time to
                  become the definitive resource, everywhere.

                  Phase 1: Deep Localization Audit
                </h3>
                <p>
                  We started by asking a simple question: Are we truly
                  connecting with users in their own language and context? The
                  answer was not yet.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-3">
                  Instead of just translating SurveyMonkey’s content, we went
                  deeper into localization. Our team ran a granular SEO and
                  content audit across international sites, uncovering technical
                  issues that were quietly holding back growth. Things like
                  hreflang mismatches and canonical errors were sending mixed
                  signals to search engines. Once fixed, pages began speaking
                  the right “search language” to the right audience.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-3">
                  But fixing wasn’t enough. To really win, we needed to
                  understand how people search in their own voice. We carried
                  out country-specific keyword research, uncovering not just
                  generic terms but the conversational, intent-driven queries
                  people actually use. This included regional slang,
                  colloquialisms, and cultural nuances that competitors had
                  overlooked.

                  Phase 2: Product-Led AI Optimization (AIO + AEO)
                </h3>
                <p>
                  With the technical foundation solid, we shifted gears. The
                  goal was no longer just ranking; it was solving real user
                  problems at scale.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-3">
                  We analyzed how users were interacting with emerging AI
                  platforms. What questions were they asking about surveys? How
                  were they phrasing them? Patterns quickly emerged around
                  creating surveys, sharing them, and analyzing results.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-3">
                  From this, we built an AI-optimized content strategy designed
                  to make SurveyMonkey the first answer people see, whether
                  through Google, voice assistants, or generative AI summaries.
                  Existing content was restructured to be more “answer-first,”
                  while new content hubs were developed with AI discoverability
                  in mind.

                <p>
                  To make this sustainable, it couldn’t just sit with marketing;
                  it needed to become part of SurveyMonkey’s product DNA.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-3">
                  We collaborated closely with internal teams, sharing a
                  practical playbook that made AI visibility second nature. We
                  also ran training sessions so that every feature release, blog
                  post, or update was automatically optimized for AI-driven
                  discovery.

                  future-proofing the brand for the next wave of digital growth.

                  "We’ve been a household name in the US for years, but our
                  international growth has been stagnant. AI MNOITER helped us
                  move beyond traditional SEO to an AI-first approach that
                  directly speaks to how our customers actually search. This
                  isn’t just about ranking higher; it’s about a fundamental
                  shift in our strategy that has unlocked significant growth in
                  markets we had been struggling to penetrate.”

                <p>
                  SurveyMonkey’s recent transformation shows just how much the
                  digital landscape has changed. Basic SEO simply doesn’t cut it
                  anymore. These days, brands that want to stay ahead have to
                  lead with an AI-first mindset, combining localization, a sharp
                  focus on user intent, and boosting their products’ visibility
                  at every touchpoint.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-3">
                  Leveraging our experience across GEO, AEO, and AIO, we helped
                  SurveyMonkey move past the old playbook of chasing small
                  traffic gains. Instead, we built a global search strategy
                  that’s not just scalable, but genuinely future-ready,
                  engineered for the age of AI.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-3">
                  The impact goes far beyond improved rankings. SurveyMonkey now
                  has a sustainable, adaptable framework for long-term
                  visibility and growth, built to thrive in an AI-powered
                  marketplace.
