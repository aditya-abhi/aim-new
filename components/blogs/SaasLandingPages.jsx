                          conversations. Major players like Google and OpenAI
                          have reportedly signed licensing deals worth $60–$70
                          million to access Reddit’s content, highlighting just
                          how valuable a strong presence on the platform can be
                          for brand visibility in the AI ecosystem.

                          your users are already making. Include nuanced, useful
                          examples; make sure they feel valued rather than
                          targeted. Talk about your services on a platform like
                          Reddit, but make sure not to start promoting them like
                          you normally do. Slip a mention of your product and
                          how it is better. Reddit has very strict policies
