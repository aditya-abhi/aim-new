                      My journey into Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) began
                      with a fortunate accident. I was happily working as an
                      entrepreneur when one day, while researching, I noticed
                      that Microsoft Copilot made a negative comment about my
                      startup. Instead of ignoring what Copilot said, I chose to
                      understand, learn, and understand how AI-driven search
                      works, even though a lot of people around me felt that it
                      was beyond my competence. My persistence paid off as my
                      work has been featured by leading media companies such as
                      The Hindu, Yahoo, and Scroll. Most recently, I was awarded
                      the #1 GEO Consultant by YesUsers

                          intelligent, and aligned with how AI engines like

                          accurately structured, and contextually relevant so

                        <p>
                          Search is changing. Users now look to ChatGPT, Gemini,
                          and Perplexity for immediate answers rather than
                          scrolling through conventional search results. Reddit
                          has become a significant force behind AI search
                          optimization in this change.

                      My journey into Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) began
                      with a fortunate accident. I was happily working as an
                      entrepreneur when one day, while researching, I noticed
                      that Microsoft Copilot made a negative comment about my
                      startup. Instead of ignoring what Copilot said, I chose to
                      understand, learn, and understand how AI-driven search
                      works, even though a lot of people around me felt that it
                      was beyond my competence. My persistence paid off as my
                      work has been featured by leading media companies such as
                      The Hindu, Yahoo, and Scroll. Most recently, I was awarded
                      the #1 GEO Consultant by YesUsers
