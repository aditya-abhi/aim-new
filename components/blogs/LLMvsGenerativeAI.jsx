                      <p>
                        As the term suggests, Generative AI is a branch of
                        artificial intelligence systems that is capable of
                        producing new pieces of work, from scratch, to be more
                        specific: images, text, codes, music and even videos.
                        What divides this type of AI from other forms is how
                        these models go beyond simply working with data; they
                        provide zestful outcomes based on the analysis done from
                        a wide array of data.

                      <p className="mt-3">
                        Generative AI models are powered by cutting-edge
                        technologies like GANs (Generative Adversarial
                        Networks), VAEs (Variational Autoencoders), and
                        Transformers. These tools allow AI systems to “imagine”
                        new content after analyzing vast amounts of data.

                      <p className="mt-3">
                        For instance, GANs work by using two networks that play

                        other evaluates it, gradually improving the quality of
                        the generated output. Similarly, VAEs and Transformers
                        help refine how these models create new content, making
                        them incredibly versatile.

                        What Are Large Language Models (LLMs)?
                      </h2>
                      <p>
                        Large Language Models (LLMs) are a subset of generative
                        AI designed to process and generate human-like text.
                        Some new and advance models can process and generate
                        other types of content, such as code or structured data.
                        These models, built on deep learning and transformer
                        architectures, analyze vast amounts of data to
                        understand context, predict sequences, and generate
                        coherent, contextually relevant outputs.
                      </p>
                      {/* CSS Image */}
                      <h2 className="mt-3">How LLMs Work</h2>
                      <p>
                        LLMs primarily rely on <b>Transformer architecture,</b>{" "}
                        which allows them to understand the relationships
                        between words and concepts by using a mechanism called
                        self-attention. This architecture enables LLMs to
                        process input text as a whole, rather than word by word.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Unlike general generative AI models, LLMs are
                        specifically trained on vast amounts of text data—think
                        books, websites, and other written content. This
                        training makes them exceptional at tasks such as
                        translation, summarization, and chatbot-like
                        interactions.

                        Generative AI vs LLM: Key Differences
                      </h2>
                      <p>
                        Both, Generative AI and LLMs are parts of the faster
                        growing Artificial Intelligence field, but are different
                        in what they offer and have adpoted. A Generative AI is
                        constituted of multiple tools AI equipped to generate
                        content in the form of text to images and even videos,
                        whereas LLMs are trained to specifically work with and
                        produce text based content. The main differences arise
                        out of areas of difference in training data, what the
                        system can do and what it is primarily used for, which

                        While LLMs are a crucial part of generative AI, their
                        capabilities are specifically focused on language and

                        Case Study: How Netflix Uses Generative AI and LLMs

                      <p className="mt-3">
                        Netflix utilizes both generative AI and LLMs to enhance
                        its user experience. For example, generative AI is used
                        to create personalized thumbnail images for shows based
                        on what will most likely appeal to a user. On the other
                        hand, LLMs are used to recommend shows and movies by
                        analyzing user preferences and past viewing habits.

                        The most prominent one out of all is the creation of
                        deepfakes; realistic-looking fake images or videos which
                        can be used in dangerous ways. Copyright issues are also
                        a limitation, especially with the lawsuits that are
                        happening with AI content and its creators. Furthermore,
                        there is a problem with AI models that produce
                        inappropriate or harmful content. These issues are the
                        growing challenge in the AI development world today.

                        outdated and incorrect information. In addition to this,
                        standard LLMs have issues with understanding context,
                        which can be especially bad in layered or complicated
                        subjects.

                        like the Batman and Robin of the AI universe—except they
                        don’t always work together, and honestly? They’re kinda
                        rivals.

                        banjo? Generative AI’s got your back. Tools like DALL-E
                        and Runway don’t just make content—they invent it. Think
                        of it as that friend who shows up to brunch with glitter
                        in their hair and a PowerPoint for their next
