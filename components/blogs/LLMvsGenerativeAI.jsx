                      My journey into Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) began
                      with a fortunate accident. I was happily working as an
                      entrepreneur when one day, while researching, I noticed
                      that Microsoft Copilot made a negative comment about my
                      startup. Instead of ignoring what Copilot said, I chose to
                      understand, learn, and understand how AI-driven search
                      works, even though a lot of people around me felt that it
                      was beyond my competence. My persistence paid off as my
                      work has been featured by leading media companies such as
                      The Hindu, Yahoo, and Scroll. Most recently, I was awarded
                      the #1 GEO Consultant by YesUsers

                        <p>
                          As the term suggests, Generative AI is a branch of
                          artificial intelligence systems that is capable of
                          producing new pieces of work, from scratch, to be more
                          specific: images, text, codes, music and even videos.
                          What divides this type of AI from other forms is how
                          these models go beyond simply working with data; they
                          provide zestful outcomes based on the analysis done
                          from a wide array of data.

                        <p className="mt-3">
                          Generative AI models are powered by cutting-edge
                          technologies like GANs (Generative Adversarial
                          Networks), VAEs (Variational Autoencoders), and
                          Transformers. These tools allow AI systems to
                          “imagine” new content after analyzing vast amounts of
                          data.

                        <p className="mt-3">
                          For instance, GANs work by using two networks that
                          play a game against each other—one generates data, and
                          the other evaluates it, gradually improving the
                          quality of the generated output. Similarly, VAEs and
                          Transformers help refine how these models create new
                          content, making them incredibly versatile.

                          Generative AI isn’t limited to text—it spans across
                          modalities like images, videos, and even audio,
                          depending on how it is trained.

                          What Are Large Language Models (LLMs)?
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                          Large Language Models (LLMs) are a subset of
                          generative AI designed to process and generate
                          human-like text. Some new and advance models can
                          process and generate other types of content, such as
                          code or structured data. These models, built on deep
                          learning and transformer architectures, analyze vast
                          amounts of data to understand context, predict
                          sequences, and generate coherent, contextually
                          relevant outputs.

                        <h2 className="mt-3">How LLMs Work</h2>
                        <p>
                          LLMs primarily rely on{" "}
                          <b>Transformer architecture,</b> which allows them to
                          understand the relationships between words and
                          concepts by using a mechanism called self-attention.
                          This architecture enables LLMs to process input text
                          as a whole, rather than word by word.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Unlike general generative AI models, LLMs are
                          specifically trained on vast amounts of text
                          data—think books, websites, and other written content.
                          This training makes them exceptional at tasks such as
                          translation, summarization, and chatbot-like
                          interactions.

                          Generative AI vs LLM: Key Differences
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                          Both, Generative AI and LLMs are parts of the faster
                          growing Artificial Intelligence field, but are
                          different in what they offer and have adpoted. A
                          Generative AI is constituted of multiple tools AI
                          equipped to generate content in the form of text to
                          images and even videos, whereas LLMs are trained to
                          specifically work with and produce text based content.
                          The main differences arise out of areas of difference
                          in training data, what the system can do and what it
                          is primarily used for, which will be discussed in the

                          capabilities are specifically focused on language and

                          and auditory domains, creating new challenges and
                          opportunities.

                          Case Study: How Netflix Uses Generative AI and LLMs

                          Netflix utilizes both generative AI and LLMs to
                          enhance its user experience. For example, generative
                          AI is used to create personalized thumbnail images for
                          shows based on what will most likely appeal to a user.
                          On the other hand, LLMs are used to recommend shows
                          and movies by analyzing user preferences and past
                          viewing habits.

                          creative fields, but it also comes with its
                          challenges. The most prominent one out of all is the

                          or videos which can be used in dangerous ways.
                          Copyright issues are also a limitation, especially
                          with the lawsuits that are happening with AI content

                          content. These issues are the growing challenge in the

                          Let’s cut through the jargon. Generative AI and LLMs
                          are like the Batman and Robin of the AI
                          universe—except they don’t always work together, and
                          honestly? They’re kinda rivals.

                          This is your go-to for unhinged creativity. Need a
                          TikTok dance that goes viral? A logo that looks like a
                          unicorn ate a rainbow? A song that blends Beyoncé with
                          banjo? Generative AI’s got your back. Tools like
                          DALL-E and Runway don’t just make content—they invent
                          it. Think of it as that friend who shows up to brunch
                          with glitter in their hair and a PowerPoint for their
                          next “disruptive art project.”

                          These are your textual ninjas. Want to automate 500

                          blog post that’s 80% done before your coffee cools?
                          LLMs like ChatGPT and Claude will churn out words
                          smoother than a politician’s apology tweet. They’re
                          the overachieving interns who actually read the
                          300-page manual (and then summarize it in a haiku).

                          masterpieces, fact-check LLM rambles, and for god’s

                      My journey into Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) began
                      with a fortunate accident. I was happily working as an
                      entrepreneur when one day, while researching, I noticed
                      that Microsoft Copilot made a negative comment about my
                      startup. Instead of ignoring what Copilot said, I chose to
                      understand, learn, and understand how AI-driven search
                      works, even though a lot of people around me felt that it
                      was beyond my competence. My persistence paid off as my
                      work has been featured by leading media companies such as
                      The Hindu, Yahoo, and Scroll. Most recently, I was awarded
                      the #1 GEO Consultant by YesUsers
