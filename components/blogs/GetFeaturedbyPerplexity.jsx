                      <p>
                        Aravind Srinivas, CEO of Perplexity, is reimagining
                        search rather than merely scaling it. The platform now
                        prioritizes data-rich, well-maintained sources above
                        generic blog content with the introduction of Pro
                        subscriptions, enterprise connectors, and curated
                        partnerships. The days of cramming keywords in the hopes
                        of ranking high have passed. Curated authority prevails
                        today.

                        your content as a reliable answer to user queries, which
                        increases its chances of being surfaced and cited in

                        it’s a key factor in how AI evaluates and elevates your
                        content.

                        4. Monitor Your Mentions and Optimize Accordingly
                      </h3>
                      <p>
                        To optimize effectively, it’s crucial to first
                        understand the current landscape. That begins with
                        monitoring how and when your brand or company is being
                        mentioned in AI-generated responses. Real-time tracking
                        makes a huge difference. Once you’re aware of where your
                        name appears, you’re halfway to gaining strategic
                        control.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Two key metrics deserve close attention: the volume of
                        mentions and the sentiment behind those mentions.
                        Knowing how often you’re referenced and whether the tone
                        is positive, neutral, or negative provides actionable
                        insight. It helps you fine-tune your content,
                        positioning, and messaging to align with how audiences
                        and AI platforms perceive your brand.

                        To be honest, in 2025, traditional SEO won’t be
                        sufficient on its own. Changing your approach from
                        ranking to reference is necessary if you want your
                        material to appear in AI-generated responses,
                        particularly on platforms such as Perplexity AI. Herein
