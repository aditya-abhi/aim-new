                      <p className="mt-3">
                        Gymshark worked with TikTok’s algorithm and short-form
                        videos to produce relatable fitness content.

                        process, Gymshark used small influencers which meant
                        that they had more interactions with their clients
                        making them accountable for 25% of the sales resulting
