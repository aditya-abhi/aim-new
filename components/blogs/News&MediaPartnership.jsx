                        gatekeepers, but they’re not passive librarians. They’re
                        aggressive curators, rewriting your content, citing it

                        authoritative publishers are their favorite textbooks.
                        Nail those partnerships, and you’re essentially handing
                        AI a cheat sheet with your brand’s name at the top.

                        crawlers read you as an authority. The more reference
                        sentences, the higher you can rank in generative

                      <p>
                        AI models evolve constantly, and so should your
                        partnerships. Staying agile ensures your brand stays
                        quoted, relevant, and top of mind for both humans and
                        algorithms.

                        GEO isn’t about chasing algorithms—it’s about being the

                        are asking, and hence would be relevant to AI
                        algorithms. Partner with trusted voices, speak
                        conversationally, and stay agile.

                        the harder it is for competitors (or AI) to ignore you.
