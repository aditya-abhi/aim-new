                        Google’s AI Overview is now the new king of the SERP,
                        and AI is changing the rules of SEO. Blue links and
                        metadata are no longer the exclusive components of
                        search. Google AI Overview will be the new gatekeeper of
                        visibility in 2025, changing the way people discover and
                        trust brands. That AI-generated summary block at the top
                        of search results, which provides an answer to the query
                        before anyone even scrolls, is likely something you’ve
                        seen. This is Google’s AI Overview, which stealthily
                        diverts traffic from sponsored advertisements, snippets,
                        and organic rankings.

                      <p>
                        In a word? Your clicks are being stolen, and SEO is
                        being redefined. Google AI Overview is an AI-driven
                        feature that appears at the top of many search results,
                        summarizing information from multiple sources into a
                        single, clear, and concise response. Users are not
                        required to click, scroll, or search. They get the
                        answer they were looking for immediately, and your
                        content may be cited or disregarded. You do not have any
                        control over this. While traditional rankings are still
                        important, users no longer view them first.

                      <p className="mt-3">

                        new playbook for content strategy in 2025. It’s not
                        about just ranking high, it’s about being trusted enough
                        by AI so that it quotes you. So, yes, the big deal is

                        AI Overview is essentially Google’s answer to programs
                        like Perplexity and ChatGPT. “We’ll answer your question
                        before you even leave the page,” is how Google puts it.
                        The goal of the new SEO strategy is to become the
                        reliable source that AI uses, whereas the previous one
                        may have been centered on keyword ranking. And that’s
                        where Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) comes in.

                        How Google Picks Content for AI Overview (Hint: It’s Not
                        Just Rankings)
                      </h2>
                      <p>
                        Do you think being in the AI Overview is guaranteed if
                        you rank #1 on Google? Rethink that idea. According to
                        the Semrush AI Overviews Study (2025), 85% of the
                        sources listed in Google’s AI Overviews don’t even show
                        up in the top 10 organic search results.

                        Google isn’t just picking and choosing based on the
                        keyword match. It’s AI filters content based on value,
                        clarity, and relevance to the user’s query, not just
                        SERP position.

                      <p>
                        Does your material give a clear and direct answer to the
                        user’s question? AI Overview chooses content that
                        provides value quickly instead of just summarizing. The
                        intent of the query is very important in AI Overview.
                        Your response may be overlooked if it contains
                        unnecessary details or distractions.

                        AI Overview pulls from multiple sources, not just
                        top-ranking articles, to recommend tools like Microsoft
                        Teams and Trello. It’s a perfect example of how
                        Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) can help your
                        product or guide get featured based on usefulness, not
