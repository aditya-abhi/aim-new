                        The rules of search are changing faster than most

                        By 2025, a great chunk of the population plans to switch
                        to ChatGPT and similar LLMs for queries instead of
                        Google. Providing a quick, conversational answer

                        Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) has emerged as the
                        key strategy to ensure content is favorably recognized

                        was just 300 monthly visitors. After shutting down paid
                        ads to focus on organic growth, they adopted an
