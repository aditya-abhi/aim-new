                      My journey into Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) began
                      with a fortunate accident. I was happily working as an
                      entrepreneur when one day, while researching, I noticed
                      that Microsoft Copilot made a negative comment about my
                      startup. Instead of ignoring what Copilot said, I chose to
                      understand, learn, and understand how AI-driven search
                      works, even though a lot of people around me felt that it
                      was beyond my competence. My persistence paid off as my
                      work has been featured by leading media companies such as
                      The Hindu, Yahoo, and Scroll. Most recently, I was awarded
                      the #1 GEO Consultant by YesUsers

                        Google hosted its annual I/O developer conference last
                        Tuesday and introduced a series of artificial
                        intelligence products. These include new search and chat
                        features and AI hardware for cloud customers,
                        underlining Google’s insistence on AI even as rivals
                        like OpenAI emerge.

                        The switch from traditional results based on links to
                        summaries generated by AI reveals a step towards a more
                        intuitive and integrated search experience. Many
                        industry experts have referred to this as the ‘day zero’
                        of Google search, the information retrieval technology
                        that makes it easy for users to get quick insights into
                        complex topics without having them move away from their
                        initial queries.

                        Generative AI significantly shifts from traditional
                        keyword-based searching towards more intuitive,
                        context-aware methods. It can generate and comprehend
                        text that sounds human-like, so users get a
                        comprehensive overview of their search queries

                        With the help of Gemini, Google’s latest AI model, they
                        aim to revolutionize users’ interaction with search
                        results. To start, Google has introduced AI Overviews
                        (earlier Google SGE), which essentially provides a
                        summary of search results with links for further
                        details, transforming how users search for information
                        on Google.

                        faster, more precise, and exceptionally user-friendly.
                        As AI Overviews roll out to users in the United States
                        with plans for global expansion, casual users and
                        professionals in fields like marketing should notice.

                        AI Overviews is a new Google search feature that uses
                        generative AI to create quick answers to search queries
                        through a topic preview with links to learn more.
                        Powered by Google Gemini, it combines information from
                        multiple online sources to save the searcher time and
                        provide a general overview – hence the name.

                        How Do AI Overviews Work?
                      </h2>
                      <p>
                        Here’s a general model of how AI Overviews generate
                        responses:
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <b>Query Processing:</b>Once you type in a query, the
                          AI transforms your words into a vector, just as
                          ChatGPT works.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <b>Document Selection: </b>Google’s algorithm selects
                          a few relevant web pages containing information
                          related to the generated response.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <b>Fact-Checking: </b>These chosen documents act as
                          fact-checkers. If there is any contradiction between
                          the AI-generated text and the information provided in
                          these documents, then the AI modifies its response
                          accordingly. Hence, you can see the “sources”
                          mentioned each time.

                        <li>

                          required to determine the response’s accuracy and
                          relevance before presenting it.

                        At one point, an AI summary was produced by about 85% of

                        reversed, and at present, approximately 14% of searches
                        produce an AI Summary. The likelihood of triggering an
                        AI summary varies considerably across domains,
                        fluctuating between 1% and 25%.

                        Traditional page views may be adversely affected when AI

                        Google’s AI overviews, about 25% of the traffic could be
                        negatively affected by the de-emphasis on website links,
                        said Marc McCollum, chief innovation officer at Raptive.

                        The key point is: don’t panic. Most AI responses are
                        aimed at less common, less searched-for queries, which
                        are generally unlikely to have a significant impact on
                        most sites.

                      Why stress about your website’s SEO when you could

                      My journey into Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) began
                      with a fortunate accident. I was happily working as an
                      entrepreneur when one day, while researching, I noticed
                      that Microsoft Copilot made a negative comment about my
                      startup. Instead of ignoring what Copilot said, I chose to
                      understand, learn, and understand how AI-driven search
                      works, even though a lot of people around me felt that it
                      was beyond my competence. My persistence paid off as my
                      work has been featured by leading media companies such as
                      The Hindu, Yahoo, and Scroll. Most recently, I was awarded
