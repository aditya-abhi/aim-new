                      <p>
                        Let's say it simply: as the search itself gets
                        conversational and artificial intelligence-driven, being
                        an outward (and trusted) answer is more important than
                        ever. Users aren't clicking through several pages; they
                        need answers now, and they need them transparent and
                        credible.

                        In essence, an answer engine is a system usually driven
                        by AI that doesn't merely locate information; it returns
                        the precise answer you're seeking in the shortest path
                        possible.

                        of potential sources for you to sort through, answer
                        engines scan massive amounts of information, extract the
                        pertinent facts, and respond on the fly, often in
                        natural, everyday language. s

                        <br />
                        OpenAI's ChatGPT (Nov 2022) changed user expectations.
                        Suddenly, people wanted human-like, conversational
                        answers to complex questions without scanning multiple
                        links.

                        Google launched SGE, and Microsoft rolled out GPT in
                        Bing Copilot, marking the beginning of search becoming
                        AI-first. The objective was no longer "find links"; it
                        was now "answer now."
