                      My journey into Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) began
                      with a fortunate accident. I was happily working as an
                      entrepreneur when one day, while researching, I noticed
                      that Microsoft Copilot made a negative comment about my
                      startup. Instead of ignoring what Copilot said, I chose to
                      understand, learn, and understand how AI-driven search
                      works, even though a lot of people around me felt that it
                      was beyond my competence. My persistence paid off as my
                      work has been featured by leading media companies such as
                      The Hindu, Yahoo, and Scroll. Most recently, I was awarded
                      the #1 GEO Consultant by YesUsers

                          In the past few years, large language models (LLMs)
                          such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and others have taken the
                          world by storm. These models are not just tools for
                          generating content. They are slowly but steadily
                          becoming the gatekeepers of the information we consume
                          online. From answering questions to drafting articles,
                          LLMs are driving content creation as well as
                          discovery.

                          real-time, LLMs dominate the content landscape. And
                          this is where your feedback becomes crucial. The more
                          feedback these models receive, the smarter they get at

                        <p>
                          To start, keep an eye out for places where you can
                          leave feedback. Here are some common spots:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li className="mt-2">

                            information provided by AI is incorrect, let them
                            know!
                          </li>

                            data. Helping the model stay current benefits both
                            you and other users.

                          Step 3: Structure Your Feedback for Maximum Impact
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                          Your feedback needs to be specific if you want it to
                          be useful. Here’s how you can structure it:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li className="mt-2">

                            <b>Good feedback: </b> “The answer should include

                        <p className="m2">
                          By being specific, you help LLMs learn faster, making

                          Conclusion
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                          As generative AI reshapes the search landscape, one
                          truth becomes undeniable: the most powerful
                          optimization happens through dialogue, not just
                          dissemination. The emergence of GEO represents a
                          fundamental shift, where user feedback doesn’t just
                          influence content quality but actively rewrites the
                          algorithms that determine visibility.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Every time you refine an AI response, upvote a helpful
                          answer, or even reformulate your search query, you’re
                          participating in a continuous optimization loop that
                          makes tomorrow’s AI outputs more precise, relevant,
                          and valuable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          This evolution turns traditional SEO on its head. No
                          longer is search optimization about static keywords
                          and backlinks alone—it’s about proving your content’s
                          worth through real-world utility.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Brands that embrace this shift will find themselves at
                          an extraordinary advantage. By actively soliciting and
                          responding to user feedback, you’re not just improving
                          individual pieces of content; you’re training AI
                          systems to recognize your expertise, trust your
                          authority, and preferentially surface your insights.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The most successful players in this new era won’t be
                          those who shout the loudest, but those who listen most
                          attentively and adapt most quickly. As LLMs grow more
                          sophisticated, this feedback loop will only
                          accelerate, making early adoption of GEO principles
                          critical for long-term visibility. The question isn’t
                          whether you should optimize for generative search, but
                          whether you’ll do so reactively or take the lead in
                          shaping how AI understands your industry.

                          because in the age of AI-driven search, those who
                          teach the machines most effectively will own the

                      My journey into Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) began
                      with a fortunate accident. I was happily working as an
                      entrepreneur when one day, while researching, I noticed
                      that Microsoft Copilot made a negative comment about my
                      startup. Instead of ignoring what Copilot said, I chose to
                      understand, learn, and understand how AI-driven search
                      works, even though a lot of people around me felt that it
                      was beyond my competence. My persistence paid off as my
                      work has been featured by leading media companies such as
                      The Hindu, Yahoo, and Scroll. Most recently, I was awarded
                      the #1 GEO Consultant by YesUsers
