                    Google hosted its annual I/O developer conference last Tuesday and introduced a series of artificial intelligence products. These include new search and chat features and AI hardware for cloud customers, underlining Google's insistence on AI even as rivals like OpenAI emerge.

                  <h2 className="h4 sm:h3">Transforming Search with AI Overviews</h2>
                  <p className="fs-6 md:fs-5">
                    The switch from traditional results based on links to summaries generated by AI reveals a step towards a more intuitive and integrated search experience. Many industry experts have referred to this as the 'day zero' of Google search, the information retrieval technology that makes it easy for users to get quick insights into complex topics without having them move away from their initial queries.
                  </p>
                  <p className="fs-6 md:fs-5">
                    Generative AI significantly shifts from traditional keyword-based searching towards more intuitive, context-aware methods. It can generate and comprehend text that sounds human-like, so users get a comprehensive overview of their search queries immediately.
                  </p>
                  <p className="fs-6 md:fs-5">
                    With the help of Gemini, Google's latest AI model, they aim to revolutionize users' interaction with search results. To start, Google has introduced AI Overviews (earlier Google SGE), which essentially provides a summary of search results with links for further details, transforming how users search for information on Google.
                  </p>
                  <p className="fs-6 md:fs-5">
                    Building on the capabilities introduced with SGE, Google is pushing the boundaries of AI in search, making it faster, more precise, and exceptionally user-friendly. As AI Overviews roll out to users in the United States with plans for global expansion, casual users and professionals in fields like marketing should notice.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h2 className="h4 sm:h3">What Are Google's AI Overviews?</h2>
                  <p className="fs-6 md:fs-5">
                    AI Overviews is a new Google search feature that uses generative AI to create quick answers to search queries through a topic preview with links to learn more. Powered by Google Gemini, it combines information from multiple online sources to save the searcher time and provide a general overview â€“ hence the name.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h3 className="h5 sm:h4">Example and Rollout</h3>
                  <p className="fs-6 md:fs-5">
                    As announced on May 14th, Google began rolling out AI Overviews to US-based searchers, with plans to expand to other countries. Originally introduced as part of the Google Search Labs experiment, Search Generative Experience (SGE), users had to opt into this feature. By the end of 2024, AI Overviews will be available to over a billion searchers.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h2 className="h4 sm:h3">How Do AI Overviews Work?</h2>
                  <p className="fs-6 md:fs-5">
                    Here's a general model of how AI Overviews generate responses:
                  </p>
                  
                  <h3 className="h5 sm:h4">Query Processing</h3>
                  <p className="fs-6 md:fs-5">
                    Once you type in a query, the AI transforms your words into a vector, just as ChatGPT works.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h3 className="h5 sm:h4">Document Selection</h3>
                  <p className="fs-6 md:fs-5">
                    Google's algorithm selects a few relevant web pages containing information related to the generated response.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h3 className="h5 sm:h4">Fact-Checking</h3>
                  <p className="fs-6 md:fs-5">
                    These chosen documents act as fact-checkers. If there is any contradiction between the AI-generated text and the information provided in these documents, then the AI modifies its response accordingly. Hence, you can see the "sources" mentioned each time.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h3 className="h5 sm:h4">Evaluation</h3>
                  <p className="fs-6 md:fs-5">
                    An extra evaluation step might be required to determine the response's accuracy and relevance before presenting it.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h2 className="h4 sm:h3">The Impact of AI Overviews on SEO So Far</h2>
                  <p className="fs-6 md:fs-5">
                    At one point, an AI summary was produced by about 85% of search queries. However, this trend has undoubtedly reversed, and at present, approximately 14% of searches produce an AI Summary. The likelihood of triggering an AI summary varies considerably across domains, fluctuating between 1% and 25%.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h3 className="h5 sm:h4">User Concerns</h3>
                  <p className="fs-6 md:fs-5">
                    Currently, users cannot opt out of AI Overviews, leading to frustration among some who have flooded Google's help forums for advice on disabling them. The Google trends chart for "turn off Google AI" spiked over the week that AI Overviews were launched, highlighting widespread discontent.
                  </p>
                  <p className="fs-6 md:fs-5">
                    Given the scale of its release and the extensive amount of Search Engine Results Page ("SERP") real estate it takes up, SEO professionals are concerned about how it will impact their organic rankings and overall SEO performance.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h3 className="h5 sm:h4">Concerns for Publishers</h3>
                  <p className="fs-6 md:fs-5">
                    Traditional page views may be adversely affected when AI Overviews consolidate content, leading to decreased ad revenue and lower content engagement. Based on habits that emerged during the past year's testing phase of Google's AI overviews, about 25% of the traffic could be negatively affected by the de-emphasis on website links, said Marc McCollum, chief innovation officer at Raptive.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h3 className="h5 sm:h4">Transactional Keywords and Local Intent</h3>
                  <p className="fs-6 md:fs-5">
                    In some cases, AI Overviews may be seen for longer-tail queries with transactional intent but only sometimes for short-tail ones. AI Overviews no longer show for local queries based on our sample. However, this might change in the future.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h3 className="h5 sm:h4">Informational Keywords are Most Affected</h3>
                  <p className="fs-6 md:fs-5">
                    AI overviews are mainly triggered by informational searches, especially those related to procedures or tasks.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h3 className="h5 sm:h4">Authoritative Domains</h3>
                  <p className="fs-6 md:fs-5">
                    AI Overviews are available for authoritative domains such as health, legal, and finance. However, they often come with the recommendation to consult experts in the field and to use the advice at the user's own risk.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h2 className="h4 sm:h3">Why Are AI Overviews So Limited?</h2>
                  <p className="fs-6 md:fs-5">
                    The limited appearance of AI overviews suggests some hesitation from Google in launching a full-scale implementation. Potential reasons include:
                  </p>
                  <p className="fs-6 md:fs-5">
                    Intent mismatch between search queries and AI Overviews. Fewer filters and features compared to traditional search results.

                    We have also invented a novel framework for analyzing website prominence in AI summaries.

                  <h2 className="h4 sm:h3">Conclusion</h2>
                  <p className="fs-6 md:fs-5">
                    The key point is: don't panic. Most AI responses are aimed at less common, less searched-for queries, which are generally unlikely to have a significant impact on most sites.
                  </p>
                  <p className="fs-6 md:fs-5">
                    Why stress about your website's SEO when you could prioritize these vital queries for your site instead? If you notice AI Overviews appearing for specific queries, aim to become one of the featured sources.
