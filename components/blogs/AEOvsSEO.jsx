                        <strong>best hiking boots for rocky terrain.</strong>”
                        In 2015, you’d scroll through 10 blue links. In 2025?
                        Google’s AI Overview instantly compares top brands,
                        prices, and durability specs—citing sources like REI and
                        OutdoorGearLab—while ChatGPT drafts you a packing list.

                        This shift underscores the critical debate of AEO vs

                        <strong>the game’s changed</strong>. This is the reality
                        of AI-driven search. Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)
                        isn’t just “SEO’s cool younger sibling”—it’s a survival
                        skill. In this blog, we are going to cover the
                        difference between AEO and SEO.

                        three YouTube tutorials from bearded grill masters, and
                        a Reddit thread debating the merits of butter-basting

                        That was the era of keyword stuffing, a strategy that
                        feels almost laughable now. Back then, throwing in “best
