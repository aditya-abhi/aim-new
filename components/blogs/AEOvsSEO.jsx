                        In 2015, you’d scroll through 10 blue links. In 2025?

                        <strong>the game’s changed</strong>. This is the reality
                        of AI-driven search. Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)

                        skill. In this blog, we are going to cover the
                        difference between AEO and SEO.

                        lies in intent: SEO targets rankings, while AEO targets

                        “how to cook medium rare steak” (because we’ve all
                        ruined at least one $20 cut of meat, right?). Search
                        Engine is that friend who sends you 17 recipe links,
                        three YouTube tutorials from bearded grill masters, and
                        a Reddit thread debating the merits of butter-basting
                        vs. dry rubs. You’ll click, scroll past ads for
                        “revolutionary meat thermometers,” and maybe—maybe—find
                        a usable tip buried under someone’s life story about
                        their first BBQ.

                        by jamming keywords into every possible nook and cranny?
                        That was the era of keyword stuffing, a strategy that
                        feels almost laughable now. Back then, throwing in “best
                        coffee maker” fifty times was considered savvy. Can you
