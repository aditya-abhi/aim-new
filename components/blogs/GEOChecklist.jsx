                        AI mimics human comprehension—complex jargon confuses

                        AI learns from feedback loops. Correcting errors (e.g.,
                        “We’re a SaaS company, not consultants”) trains models
                        to represent your brand accurately. Encouraging user
                        feedback also crowdsources data to refine AI outputs
