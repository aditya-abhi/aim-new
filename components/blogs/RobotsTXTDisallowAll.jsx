                      My journey into Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) began
                      with a fortunate accident. I was happily working as an
                      entrepreneur when one day, while researching, I noticed
                      that Microsoft Copilot made a negative comment about my
                      startup. Instead of ignoring what Copilot said, I chose to
                      understand, learn, and understand how AI-driven search
                      works, even though a lot of people around me felt that it
                      was beyond my competence. My persistence paid off as my
                      work has been featured by leading media companies such as
                      The Hindu, Yahoo, and Scroll. Most recently, I was awarded
                      the #1 GEO Consultant by YesUsers

                          Introduction: Lessons from the Past

                        <p className="">
                          In the late 90s, many media companies decided to block
                          search engine bots, including Google, from crawling
                          their websites by using robots.txt disallow all
                          feature in their robots.txt file. They felt that
                          search engines were unfairly exploiting their content.
                          But boy, oh boy! It was a big mistake when it came to
                          their web traffic. Over time, they came to realize
                          that collaboration, not exclusion, drove visibility,
                          traffic, and revenue.

                          Mark Twain once said, “History Doesn’t Repeat Itself,
                          but It Often Rhymes.” In line with this statement,
                          businesses today grapple with a similar dilemma about
                          AI and LLM crawlers such as GPTBot and PerplexityBot.

                        <p>
                          There is growing anxiety among content creators and
                          businesses about how proprietary data might be
                          utilized to train these models.
                        </p>
                        <p className="mt-3">
                          The concerns revolve around misuse and the potential
                          for distorting their intellectual property. Despite
                          these valid worries, it’s essential to consider the
                          implications of shutting out AI crawlers entirely.

                          prevent your content from being used to train large
                          language models (LLMs), but it will also make your
                          brand, company, and offerings invisible to these LLMs.

                          My perspective on this issue is to strike a balance. I
                          advise allowing access to these bots while denying
                          access to your copyrighted and subscription-based
                          content. This approach, if implemented effectively,
                          will enable you to safeguard your interests while
                          boosting your brand’s online presence and user

                          A <strong>robots.txt</strong> file is kind of like a
                          concert pass, telling web crawlers who can get in and
                          where they’re allowed to go. Just as only those with a
                          backstage pass can access restricted areas at a
                          concert, <strong>robots.txt</strong> lets you specify
                          which parts of your website search engine bots can
                          visit and which areas are off-limits.

                          index your site, preventing them from accessing
                          sensitive or unnecessary pages and helping to reduce
                          server load. However, it’s important to remember that

                          suggestion to crawlers, and some may ignore your
                          robots.txt entirely. For this reason, robots.txt
                          shouldn’t be relied on as a security measure since
                          determined or malicious crawlers can easily bypass it.

                          In my personal opinion, blocking AI crawlers today is
                          as myopic as blocking Google in the 90s. The key lies
                          in strategic access—shielding critical data while
                          ensuring your brand remains part of the AI-driven

                          transparency, and position your content for the

                      My journey into Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) began
                      with a fortunate accident. I was happily working as an
                      entrepreneur when one day, while researching, I noticed
                      that Microsoft Copilot made a negative comment about my
                      startup. Instead of ignoring what Copilot said, I chose to
                      understand, learn, and understand how AI-driven search
                      works, even though a lot of people around me felt that it
                      was beyond my competence. My persistence paid off as my
                      work has been featured by leading media companies such as
                      The Hindu, Yahoo, and Scroll. Most recently, I was awarded
                      the #1 GEO Consultant by YesUsers
