                        simple—Markdown is just super easy to read for both
                        people and machines. It lays out information in a clear
                        and structured way without all the fuss of full-on HTML
                        coding. LLMs don’t have to deal with all those tags and
                        scripts, which is a relief. That simplicity means LLMs
                        can quickly parse it and understand the content with way
                        less confusion, making everything process more
                        efficiently.

                        Difference?

                        I promise this is the last curveball I’m throwing in
                        this article. Before continuing, you should know that
                        llms.txt comes in two flavors. The first one you
                        probably already know is llms.txt, and the second one is
                        llms-full.txt.

                        between llms-full.txt and llms.txt is comparing it to a

                        llms.txt is a concise version that highlights the most
                        essential parts of your site. Even though there’s no
                        strict rule on how long it should be, keeping it around
                        5-10 links is suggested. It’s like getting a quick
                        overview of everything your site offers in just one

                        shebang—it’s like trying to pack every tiny detail of
                        your website into one text file. That level of granular
                        detail can be super helpful for website owners in
                        influencing how LLMs perceive their website.
