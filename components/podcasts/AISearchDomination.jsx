                                  First up was implementing that LLMs.txt file,
                                  basically, you know, telling AI crawlers how
                                  to play nice with your site. Right. The
                                  AIrobots.txt. Then we looked at Reddit, how
                                  participating there builds authority.
                                </p>

                                  Really important. Yep. Third, we talked about
                                  using authoritative citations strategically,
                                  getting those mentions in the right places.

                                  Crucial. And just last time we discussed
                                  evolving your sort of traditional SEO playbook
                                  for this new world of generative engine
                                  optimization, or answer engine optimization,
                                  as some call it. Okay, so what's next on the
                                  list? We're on number five.

                                  Number five. Today we're tackling why public
                                  relations PR is absolutely critical now in the
                                  age of AI search. Yeah, this one's big.

                                  You might think, oh, PR, that's just press
                                  releases. Right. Okay.

                                  massively. And it might just hold the key to
                                  your brand's future visibility. It really
                                  might.
                                </p>

                                  Okay, let's unpack this one. All right. So the
                                  fundamental thing to grasp is how people find
                                  information online.
                                </p>

                                  It's just radically changing. Right. Those
                                  traditional blue links on Google, they're
                                  still there, but they're being displaced more
                                  and more.
                                </p>

                                  How so? What's displacing them? Well, a few
                                  things. Think about AI-generated summaries
                                  first. Like Google's AI overviews.
                                </p>

                                  Yeah, they're everywhere now. Billions of
                                  searches per day are showing those now.
                                  Billions.
                                </p>

                                  And it's not just Google summaries, is it?
                                  What about the chatbots, the conversational
                                  interfaces? Exactly. Tools like ChatGT,
                                  Claude, they're offering direct answers. You
                                  don't even need to click? Pretty much.

                                  60%. So most people aren't clicking through.

                                  They see the AI overview or the featured
                                  snippet, get what they need, and boom, done.
                                  Okay, so if clicks aren't the main goal, or at
                                  least not the only goal, what signals does AI
                                  search care about then? What's the new
                                  currency? That is the million-dollar question,
                                  isn't it? And the answer is, well, it's
                                  different. Traditional SEO stuff like
                                  backlinks, content relevance, still matters,
                                  don't get me wrong, but AI seems to primarily
                                  focus on other things, entities like specific
                                  brands, people, concepts, and also reputation
                                  and authority signals.
                                </p>

                                  But it gathers these signals from all over the
                                  web, not just links. So it's a little broader.
                                  Much broader.

                                  It fundamentally changes how info gets
                                  surfaced, how it gets cited, how it's
                                  prioritized. It's less about just a link
                                  graph, maybe more like a trust graph, you
                                  know? A trust graph. I like that.

                                  And I've seen some, well, some pretty
                                  eye-opening research about what correlates
                                  with visibility in these AI systems, what's
                                  driving that trust. You're probably thinking
                                  about the studies on brand mentions. And yeah,
                                  they are eye-opening.

                                  Ahrefs looked at 75,000 brands and found that
                                  branded web mentions, just mentions of the
                                  brand name, had the strongest correlation with
                                  visibility in AI overviews. Is it stronger
                                  than backlinks? Significantly stronger. Brands
                                  with the most web mentions, they showed up in
                                  like up to 10 times more AI overviews.

                                  10 times. That really does flip traditional

                                  models is not that. The currency of large

                                  the more often your brand is mentioned in
                                  relevant, high quality places within that

                                  The more likely the AI is to see it and use
                                  it. Exactly. The more likely it is to be
                                  included when the AI generates an answer
                                  related to what you do.

                                  straight. Basically, it's as simple as this.
                                  If you want your brand to show up consistently
                                  in AI tools and LLM responses, just putting
                                  good content on your own site, that's not
                                  enough anymore.

                                  Not nearly enough. Your brand needs to be
                                  talked about accurately, contextually,
                                  authoritatively, in the right places, by the
                                  right voices, all across the web. Is that the
                                  new reality? That's pretty much the core of
                                  it, yeah.

                                  It's less about building a static structure of
                                  links and more like cultivating an ecosystem,
                                  a thriving web of credible mentions around
                                  your brand. An ecosystem of mentions. The AI
                                  isn't just counting links.
                                </p>

                                  <br />
                                  It's looking at the whole picture, the
                                  patterns, the context, the frequency of your
                                  brand showing up credibly. Which brings us
                                  directly to PR. How does digital PR fit into
                                  creating this ecosystem? Well, this is exactly
                                  why digital PR suddenly becomes not just, you
                                  know, nice to have, but absolutely essential.
                                </p>

                                  It's probably one of the most effective ways
                                  to secure those authoritative brand mentions.
                                  The kind that appear on high-quality,
                                  trustworthy sources. The kind of sources AI
                                  models are trained on? Precisely.
                                </p>

                                  <br />
                                  Those are the sources they learn from and draw
                                  from when they build their answers. PR is
                                  about getting those high-value mentions. So
                                  landing some expert commentary in a major news
                                  outlet or maybe contributing to an industry
                                  roundup or even just getting covered on a
                                  really relevant niche blog.
                                </p>

                                  <br />
                                  All of that, yes. Digital PR puts your brand
                                  in those important places. It helps build that
                                  rich web of brand mentions you talked about.
                                </p>

                                  <br />
                                  Exactly. A web that the AI models are likely
                                  to crawl, learn from, and then hopefully cite.
                                  So it feels like PR's value proposition just
                                  got a massive upgrade, right? I think so,
                                  yeah.
                                </p>

                                  For years, PR folks have been saying, hey,
                                  brand mentions help visibility and authority.
                                  Now with AI in the mix, we can say it with way
                                  more confidence, that high-quality feature in
                                  a top publication, even if it doesn't have a
                                  backlink, if it has strong contextual mentions
                                  of your brand, that's a huge win now. Maybe
                                  even bigger than a link in some cases.
                                </p>

                                  Because those mentions directly teach the LLM
                                  about you. Exactly. They help the AI
                                  understand who you are, what you do, why
                                  you're credible, what topics you're associated
                                  with.

                                  And getting surfaced in those AI overviews,
                                  which sit right at the top of search results,
                                  that's like earned visibility gold. It's
                                  earned visibility at massive scale. And think
                                  about it.

                                  PR's core job is to position your brand as a
                                  credible expert, right? A go-to solution. So
                                  when an AI tool actually selects your brand to
                                  help answer a user's query, that's an
                                  incredibly powerful signal. It reinforces the
                                  very authority and trustworthiness that PR
                                  aims to build.

                                  OK, that makes perfect sense. But it can't all
                                  be positive, can it? What are the potential
                                  downsides of relying on LLM visibility? You're
                                  right. It's definitely a double-edged sword.
                                </p>

                                  Let's talk upsides first, though. OK. The big
                                  one is massive reach.
                                </p>

                                  <br />
                                  Your brand gets seen by tons of users
                                  interacting with these AI summaries. Right.
                                  Exposure.

                                  Then there's perceived authority. Being
                                  mentioned by an AI, it carries this sort of
                                  implicit endorsement. Users tend to assume the
                                  AI is surfacing reliable stuff.
                                </p>

                                <p>

                                  Sure. Consistent exposure builds brand
                                  awareness, top-of-mind recall, even if they
                                  don't click right then. OK.
                                </p>

                                  But the downside. It seems like the big one is
                                  clicks, right? The thing traditional SEO
                                  always measured. That's the major challenge.
                                </p>

                                  Yeah. If the AI answers the question well
                                  enough right there in the overview... Why
                                  would they click through to your site?
                                  Exactly. They might not need to.
                                </p>

                                  Which leads straight to attribution
                                  challenges. How so? Well, these AI responses
                                  often blend info from multiple sources. And
                                  they don't always cite them clearly or
                                  consistently.
                                </p>

                                  So it becomes really hard to track when your
                                  brand was mentioned or measure the direct
                                  impact, like a click or a conversion from that
                                  mention. And you mentioned inconsistency.
                                  Yeah.
                                </p>

                                  AI responses can vary depending on the
                                  specific model, how the user phrases the
                                  query, even the time of day sometimes. So your
                                  visibility might fluctuate. OK.
                                </p>

                                  So less direct traffic, hard to track. What
                                  does the data show? Well, we're seeing it
                                  already. Since AI overviews really rolled out,
                                  a lot of search marketers are reporting that
                                  impressions in Search Console are kind of
                                  creeping up.

                                  OK. So people are seeing the results. Clicks

                                  Or even falling. It's a pretty clear sign
                                  users are getting info directly from the AI,
                                  which, you know, if you're only measuring
                                  clicks, that's frustrating. Your old KPIs, key
                                  performance indicators, might look bad.

                                  It really does feel like we're stepping back
                                  in time a bit, doesn't it? To like old school
                                  PR before everything was digitally trackable.
                                  It kind of does. You get that great magazine
                                  feature.
                                </p>

                                  You knew it was valuable, but you couldn't
                                  track exactly who read it or what they did
                                  next. Precisely. And now we're sort of back
                                  there, but in this new AI context.
                                </p>

                                  <br />
                                  We don't always have reliable ways to measure
                                  every AI mentions direct impact. But the
                                  impact is still happening. We believe so, yes.
                                </p>

                                <p>

                                  Which means our attribution models, the ones
                                  relying purely on direct clicks, they're
                                  becoming outdated fast. Yeah. So we need to
                                  shift focus.
                                </p>

                                <p>

                                  Definitely. We need to measure things like
                                  brand awareness, sentiment, recall more
                                  broadly, understand that indirect impact. Like
                                  someone sees your brand in an AI answer,
                                  doesn't click them, but maybe they search for
                                  you later or convert through a different
                                  channel.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  (11:47 - 12:00)
                                  <br />
                                  Exactly that. That indirect path is becoming
                                  much more significant. So what should brands
                                  be tracking then? What are the new metrics?
                                  Well, smart brands are looking at a basket of
                                  things, growth in search volume for their
                                  brand name and key product terms.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  (12:00 - 12:07)
                                  <br />
                                  Okay. Makes sense. They're looking for uplift
                                  in direct website traffic, especially after
                                  big PR pushes or coverage.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  (12:07 - 12:18)
                                  <br />
                                  Correlating activity. Yeah. And using social
                                  listening tools, brand sentiment analysis,
                                  looking for spikes in visibility or positive
                                  mentions that might line up with AI features.
                                </p>

                                  So it's about reading between the lines a bit
                                  more. Pretty much. Understanding that
                                  influence and visibility don't always come
                                  with a neat little tracking link attached.
                                </p>

                                  LLM visibility. It's often about long-term
                                  brand building, reputation, not just those
                                  immediate clicks. Okay.
                                </p>

                                  So given this whole new landscape, it sounds
                                  like, well, SEO teams and PR teams really need
                                  to talk to each other now. Oh, absolutely.
                                  They can't operate in silos anymore.
                                </p>

                                  They have to align on target topics,
                                  audiences, messaging. It's crucial. So
                                  collaboration is step one.
                                </p>

                                  What else? What are the practical steps for
                                  brands wanting to leverage PR for AI
                                  visibility? Strategically, you need to
                                  prioritize getting high-quality mentions from
                                  authoritative sources. Media outlets, key
                                  influencers in your space. Quality over
                                  quantity.

                                  Definitely. And build strong topical
                                  authority. Consistently get coverage around
                                  the core subjects you want your brand to own
                                  in AI results.
                                </p>

                                  That consistency helps the AI make the
                                  connection. What about the actual content of
                                  the PR? Does that need to change? Yeah. Think
                                  about being quotable.
                                </p>

                                  Craft unique insights, maybe some original
                                  data points, provocative quotes. Stuff that
                                  journalists and bloggers actually want to pick
                                  up and cite. Make it easy for them to mention
                                  you.

                                  Exactly. Right. So we've laid out how PR can
                                  really boost visibility in AI search.

                                  But it's not just about using AI, is it? AI
                                  itself is changing the PR game, sometimes in
                                  challenging ways. Oh, absolutely. There's
                                  definitely another side to the rise of
                                  generative AI.

                                  While amazing for drafting things quickly, it
                                  doesn't replace human creativity, right? And
                                  we're seeing this flood of content that's,
                                  well, kind of similar. Lifeless, even.
                                  AI-generated content can be pretty bland.

                                  It can be. And if it's not edited well by a
                                  human, it can feel generic, maybe even erode
                                  trust because people start questioning if it's
                                  authentic or accurate. It's a quality control
                                  issue.

                                  And it causes confusion, too, right? I heard
                                  about an experiment where people couldn't
                                  reliably tell original human writing from AI
                                  text. Yeah, that highlights the practical
                                  confusion. And we're seeing clients now
                                  starting to ask for proof that AI wasn't used
                                  or wasn't the primary author in PR work.
                                </p>

                                  Really? Demanding proof? And PR pros
                                  themselves. They need to be careful. They have

                                  get from clients before bitching them to
                                  protect their own relationships with the
                                  media.

                                  So transparency and verification are becoming
                                  huge. Huge. Which leads to the ethical side.

                                  With generative AI being so pervasive, it's
                                  really crucial that PR agencies, individual
                                  pros, everyone, develops a clear ethics code
                                  around AI use. What would that involve? Things
                                  like being transparent about AI's role,
                                  respecting privacy, ensuring data used to
                                  train or prompt AI is handled responsibly.
                                  It's about maintaining trust, basically.
                                </p>

                                <p>

                                  That's the bottom line, like that quote you
                                  mentioned earlier. In the end, ethical AI use
                                  is about maintaining trust because once that's
                                  gone, no tool can bring it back. That really
                                  sums it up.

                                  undermine the trust that connection relies on.
                                  Couldn't have said it better.

                                  So yeah, we've seen PR is definitely taking a
                                  starring role now in the AI search era. From
                                  shaping the AI's training data with quality
                                  mentions to building that deep reputation that
                                  goes beyond just links. PR isn't just
                                  supporting anymore.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  (15:37 - 15:49)
                                  <br />
                                  It's kind of leading the charge for
                                  visibility. Okay, so here's a final thought to
                                  leave everyone with. We know AI systems are,
                                  as you said, hungry for high-quality,
                                  context-rich signals from human content.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  (15:49 - 16:06)
                                  <br />
                                  Right. And we know PR is vital for creating
                                  and placing that high-quality content. So
                                  what's our collective responsibility here?
                                  What's our responsibility in making sure the
                                  information AI learns from the information PR
                                  helps generate and disseminate is actually
                                  true? That it has integrity? That's a big
                                  question.
                                </p>

                                  It feels like it goes beyond just marketing or
                                  visibility. It's about the future of
                                  information and communication itself, isn't
                                  it? Something for all of us, especially
                                  brands, to really think about. Definitely
                                  something to mull over.
