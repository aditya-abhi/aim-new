                                  searches. Wow.

                                  If you rely on a website traffic. Right. So
                                  even if you rank well traditionally, you might
                                  be, well, invisible in these AI answers.

                                  crucially, what you can actually do about it.
                                  And the rise of AI in search, it's not
                                  theoretical anymore. Google's AI overviews.

                                  They're serving over a billion users. A

                                  Perplexity, they're all becoming answer
                                  engines in their own right. Bypassing the old
                                  list of blue links sometimes.

                                  Pretty often, yeah. Yeah. Like Forbes said, if
                                  you're not in the AI answer, you might as well
                                  not exist for that search.

                                  So let's nail this down for everyone
                                  listening. What is answer engine optimization
                                  at its core? Okay, so AEO is basically tuning
                                  your online content so it directly answers the
                                  user's question. Clearly, concisely.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  (2:40 - 2:46)
                                  <br />
                                  So not just hoping they click your link. Well,
                                  that too, sometimes. But the main goal is
                                  different.
                                </p>

                                <p>

                                  <br />
                                  Traditional SEO wanted to rank your page high
                                  up in the list to get traffic. AEO aims for
                                  your content to be the featured answer itself.
                                  You mean like those boxes at the top.
                                </p>

                                  Position zero, or the answer Siri or Alexa
                                  reads out, or what shows up in Google's AI
                                  overviews. That's the AEO sweet spot. So it's
                                  less about casting a wide net with keywords to
                                  drive general traffic.

                                  source for a particular piece of information,
                                  even if the user gets the answer and doesn't
                                  click. That's a big part of it, yeah. Being
                                  that knowledge hub.

                                  SEO fought for the top 10 blue links. AEO
                                  fights for that direct answer. Slot snippets,
                                  voice, AI.

                                  Those people also ask boxes, knowledge graphs.
                                  It's a different battlefield. Okay, this
                                  definitely feels like a big evolution from the
                                  SEO playbook we've known for years.

                                  What's really driving this shift now? Well, a
                                  couple of major things. First, just how we
                                  behave as users. We're impatient.
                                </p>

                                  We want answers now. Guilty. Yeah, me too.

                                  And think about voice assistants. Something
                                  like 41% of Americans use them daily. That
                                  pushes instant answers.

                                  Right. And second, the massive advancements in
                                  AI, platforms like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini.
                                  They're incredibly good at understanding
                                  natural language and just giving you the
                                  answer, not just links.

                                  gritty then. How does AEO really differ from
                                  traditional SEO? Can we break down some key
                                  distinctions? Absolutely.

                                  ranking focus itself? SEO targets the
                                  traditional search engine results pages, those

                                  And keyword strategy differs too. SEO uses
                                  exact match, broader terms, maybe LSI
                                  keywords-related concepts. AEO leans heavily
                                  into long-tail keywords, full questions,
                                  conversational language.

                                  Think about how you'd actually ask something
                                  out loud. Well, SEO used to be a lot about
                                  things like meta tags, stuff humans don't
                                  really see. Always tracking clicks.

                                  Right. But AEO, it's more about clarity for
                                  the AI. Can the AI understand what your
                                  content is about? So less hidden stuff, more
                                  clear labels.

                                  Kind of. And success isn't just clicks
                                  anymore. It's also about tracking, you know,
                                  how often AI tools mention you or link back.
                                </p>

                                  Ah, so getting cited by the AI. Exactly.
                                  That's like free exposure, great brand
                                  recognition.

                                  amazing how these systems figure out the
                                  answers.

                                  Can you give us a quick peek under the hood?
                                  How do answer engines actually work? Well,
                                  broadly, you've got a few types. Generative
                                  AI, like ChatGPT or Gemini, voice assistants
                                  like Siri, and older query engines like
                                  Wolfram Alpha. When you ask a question, they
                                  first try to figure out your intent.
                                </p>

                                  What do you really want to know? Okay. Then
                                  they use fancy techniques like neural matching
                                  to understand the words, the context, the
                                  relationships between words. This lets them
                                  search through mountains of data to find the
                                  most relevant bit.

                                  And crucially, they learn from interactions.
                                  They get better over time based on what works
                                  for users. Fascinating.

                                  you probably need to rank well already for
                                  that.

                                  too. Sounds complex to implement, though. It

                                  Definitely. Voice search is naturally more
                                  conversational. Yeah.

                                  Uh-huh.

                                  that? Making sure the algorithms understand
                                  who you are and what you do consistently
                                  across the web. A clear digital footprint.

                                  We created a dedicated FAQ page on the AI
