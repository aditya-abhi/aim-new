                                  It's a pretty wide range. Yeah, a real mix.
                                  You get tool providers, case studies, expert

                                  It's all in there. Okay, so let's tackle this
                                  huge change in search first. AI Monitor put it
                                  pretty bluntly, didn't they? SEO is as
                                  outdated as dial-up internet.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Ha, yeah, that's quite the statement. But the
                                  core idea is this fundamental shift in how
                                  people behave online. Gartner is even
                                  forecasting, what, a 50% drop in organic web
                                  traffic.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  50%. That's massive when you think about the
                                  traffic businesses rely on. It is.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  And it's not just fewer clicks. AI Monitor
                                  also found that over 40% of users actually
                                  preferred the AI-generated content over
                                  traditional search results. So just ranking
                                  high on Google isn't the golden ticket
                                  anymore.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Not like it used to be. And AI Monitor also
                                  pointed out that these generative engines,
                                  they often reference fewer than five of the
                                  top 10 traditional results. Right, so first
                                  page doesn't guarantee visibility now.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  It's a whole different game. And users seem to
                                  be catching on fast. Forbes reported that 41%
                                  of consumers trust gen AI search more than
                                  paid search ads.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  That's significant trust. It is, maybe because
                                  the AI gives those comprehensive answers, you
                                  know. As Bloomberg Opinion noted, maybe people
                                  prefer that direct info compared to ad-filled
                                  results.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  And MIT Technology Review, they went even
                                  further, suggesting AI basically marks the end
                                  of search as we knew it, despite current
                                  hiccups like, you know, copyright stuff or
                                  inaccuracies. It's a huge thought, isn't it?
                                  And it ties right into this zero-click search
                                  idea. Ah, yes.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Hedges & Company talked about that. Search
                                  Engine Land, too. People getting answers
                                  without clicking away from Google.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Exactly. You ask the AI, it summarizes from
                                  different places, gives you the answer right
                                  there. Why click? And we're seeing the impact
                                  already.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  That mail online example from Search Engine
                                  Land was, wow. Yeah, a 56% drop in
                                  click-through rate, even when they ranked
                                  number one organically just because AI
                                  overviews showed up. Except for those really
                                  specific brand searches, like Meghan Markle
                                  Daily Mail.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Right, where the intent is clearly to go to
                                  that site. But overall, their traffic was down
                                  almost 20% year over year. It just hammers
                                  home how those old ranking metrics, they're
                                  losing their punch.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Definitely. So, if the old SEO playbook isn't
                                  cutting it, what's next? This must be where
                                  Generative Engine Optimization, GEO, fits in.
                                  Exactly, GEO.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Okay, break it down for us. What is GEO,
                                  really? Why is it so important now? So, GEO,
                                  like Wikipedia and Creator explain it, is
                                  basically optimizing your content for these AI
                                  systems, the ones that generate direct
                                  answers, not just lists of links. So, it's not
                                  about getting on the list.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  It's about being the answer the AI uses. It's
                                  a fundamental shift. And this field is pretty
                                  new, isn't it? Yeah.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Wikipedia mentioned the term really picked up
                                  after some research in 2023, and then tools
                                  started popping up fast in early 2024. Yeah,
                                  things like GetSAO, Cognizo AI, suddenly there
                                  was this specialized industry emerging. And
                                  now, in 2025, Wikipedia says it's becoming a
                                  core part of digital strategy for many,
                                  alongside traditional SEO.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Right, because the search mechanism itself is
                                  changing, moving away from just finding links
                                  to delivering these context-driven, often
                                  zero-click answers, like that 2025 study
                                  mentioned. Gotcha. And then there are all
                                  these other acronyms floating around, LLMO,
                                  AEO, GAIO, Hedges & Company, and Tuck Coop
                                  mentioned those.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  (5:35 - 6:14)
                                  <br />
                                  Yeah, there's a bit of an alphabet soup
                                  situation happening. LLMO is Large Language
                                  Model Optimization. AEO, Answer Engine
                                  Optimization.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  GAIO, Generative AI Optimization. There's one
                                  becoming the standard. Maybe not yet.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  As Tuck Coop noted, the exact term might still
                                  shake out. The main thing, the key principle,
                                  is optimizing so these LLMs, the brains behind
                                  the AI search, can understand and use your
                                  content to build their answers. Okay, that
                                  makes sense.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Focus on the principle, not just the acronym.
                                  So we get the shift, we get GAIO. What can
                                  brands actually do now? What are the concrete
                                  strategies for optimizing for these AI engines
                                  and making content AI-friendly? Well, number
                                  one, absolutely foundational, is understanding
                                  user intent.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  (6:15 - 6:29)
                                  <br />
                                  Lexicon and Creator really hit on this. AI
                                  looks at context way more deeply now. So your
                                  content needs to directly answer the real
                                  question someone's asking.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Precisely. Think about how to bake chocolate
                                  chip cookies. You can't just list ingredients.
                                  You need to anticipate follow-up questions,
                                  like substitutions or how to get them chewy
                                  versus crispy. Give the full picture.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Be comprehensive. And that ties into quality
                                  and credibility, doesn't it? EEAT, expertise,
                                  authoritativeness, trustworthiness. That's
                                  still a thing.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Oh, absolutely vital. Maybe even more so.
                                  Gravitate Design, Creator, Hedges & Company,
                                  they all stress that AI likes direct,
                                  structured, factual content. So back up your
                                  claims. Use data, cite good sources.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Yes. And Hedges & Company reminds us, building
                                  that brand visibility and trust, even more
                                  critical when an AI is deciding what
                                  information to present. OK, what about
                                  keywords? Are they dead? Not dead, but
                                  different. The strategy's evolved.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Creator talks about moving beyond just exact
                                  matches. Towards long-tail keywords, those
                                  longer, more specific phrases like
                                  eco-friendly family vacation planning for
                                  toddlers. Also, semantic keywords, which are
                                  related terms and synonyms that give context.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  And entity-based keywords focusing on specific
                                  people, places, brands, concepts the AI
                                  recognizes. Got it. Broader context, not just
                                  specific words.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Now this AI readability optimization,
                                  Gravitate Design talked about that.
                                  Structuring content so AI can process,
                                  extract, and summarize it easily. Why is that
                                  so critical?
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Well, simply put, if the AI can't easily
                                  understand your content, it's probably not
                                  going to use it to answer a query. It's about
                                  making your content easy for the AI to digest.
                                  So simpler language, shorter sentences, better
                                  formatting, good grammar. All of the above.

                                  Gravitate Design really emphasizes clarity,
                                  logical structure, using headings, lists,
                                  short paragraphs, schema markup, plus
                                  relevance, credibility, and freshness. It's
                                  like teaching your website to speak fluent AI.
                                  And Gravitate Design gave a whole list of
                                  actionable steps, right? Things we can do
                                  practically.

                                <p>
                                  For sure. Using AI writing tools, ChatGPT,
                                  Hemingway Editor, Grammarly, Readability
                                  Checkers, they can help spot where your text
                                  is maybe too dense or complex for an AI to
                                  parse effectively. And matching the
                                  readability level to your audience is key too.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Absolutely. Tone, formality, reading level.
                                  You can even prompt something like ChatGPT,
                                  like, rewrite this at an eighth grade level,
                                  keep it professional but friendly.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Practical tips. And for editing existing
                                  stuff, Gravitate mentioned things like keeping
                                  sentences under, what, 17 words? Ideally,
                                  yeah. And keeping paragraphs short, maybe two
                                  or three sentences.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Fixing grammar issues is huge passive voice,
                                  too many adverbs, wordiness, complex words.
                                  Clean it up. So clarity over complexity, use
                                  active voice, ditch the jargon, simple
                                  structures, cut unnecessary words.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Exactly. Avoid ambiguous pronouns, weak verbs,
                                  and structure matters too. Headings, lists,
                                  tables, bold text when needed, subject, verb,
                                  object, sentence structure where it makes
                                  sense, schema markup for context, good alt
                                  text for images, short sections.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  It all helps the AI navigate. And optimizing
                                  specifically for AI summaries, that's
                                  interesting. Gravitate said lead with the
                                  answer. Yeah, get straight to the point. Use
                                  headings that clearly signal what's coming
                                  next. And sort of accept that the AI will
                                  likely rephrase your content when it uses it.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  And crucially, fact check everything. Make
                                  sure the content actually matches the user's
                                  intent, answers their question fast.
                                  Definitely. But Gravitate also stresses it's
                                  not just about AI, you need that human touch.
                                  Combine the AI optimization with manual
                                  review. To catch nuances, check
                                  interpretations.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Fix formatting, refine the tone. All that.
                                  Ensure it sounds like your brand. Yeah. And
                                  they had that great success story, right?
                                  Their own guide hitting the top spot in AI
                                  overviews quickly just by following these
                                  principles. It shows this stuff works.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Okay, beyond general content, what about
                                  specifics? Like featured snippets, are those
                                  still a target? And voice search? Creators
                                  suggest that, yeah, for snippets, using
                                  question-based headings followed by concise
                                  answers is still a good strategy. Lists and
                                  tables help too. Makes sense for easy
                                  extraction.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Right. And for voice search, it's more about
                                  natural conversational language. Answering
                                  questions directly, like how someone would
                                  actually ask out loud.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Good to know some classic SEO principles
                                  haven't totally vanished, like mobile
                                  friendliness and page speed. Still important.
                                  Oh, definitely. Creator and Aleda Solis both
                                  highlight that. Good user experience is always
                                  key, and it helps search engines, including AI
                                  crawlers, access your site efficiently. And
                                  structured data.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Schema markup. Still useful. Very useful,
                                  according to creator Aleda Solis and Hedges &
                                  Company. It gives search engines extra context
                                  about your page content. Helps AI understand
                                  things better. Can lead to richer results.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Hedges specifically mentioned FAQ schema as
                                  being valuable. Right. Clarifying questions
                                  and answers.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  And lastly, freshness seems even more
                                  important now. Gravitate and Takut both
                                  mentioned that. That's right. AI tends to
                                  prefer recent, relevant info. Takut even
                                  recommended updating product content at least
                                  twice a year for e-commerce sites. Keep it
                                  current.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  OK, so if we're changing how we optimize, we
                                  must need to change how we measure success
                                  too, right? Old metrics like rankings and
                                  overall organic traffic, maybe they don't tell
                                  the whole story anymore. That's a really
                                  critical point. AI Monitor and Search Engine
                                  Land definitely suggest those traditional
                                  metrics are becoming less reliable on their
                                  own.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  So what should we be looking at? Aleda Solis
                                  offers some good alternatives. Things like how
                                  often is your brand or content mentioned or
                                  cited in the AI answers? Are you tracking
                                  traffic coming specifically from LLMs to your
                                  site? LLM traffic. Yeah, tracking visits,
                                  engagement, conversions that originated from
                                  an AI interaction.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Yeah. And monitoring brand sentiment. How are
                                  you portrayed in AI answers and the sources
                                  they use? That's becoming crucial too.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  And Hedges and Company's case studies found
                                  some interesting shifts in engagement metrics.
                                  They did. They saw, on average, things like a
                                  10% rise in engaged sessions per user, a 15%
                                  lift in engagement rate overall.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  But interestingly, a 26% drop in average time
                                  per session. Meaning people found answers
                                  faster. That's the likely interpretation,
                                  yeah.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  More efficient information discovery thanks to
                                  the AI-optimized content. And being part of
                                  the AI Monitor team, we've actually developed
                                  a tool for this, haven't we? The AI Traffic
                                  Monitor. We have.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  It's designed specifically to help you see
                                  which pages are being referenced by AI, spot
                                  technical issues blocking AI crawlers, and
                                  track those AI-driven conversions. And the
                                  early data suggests those conversions might
                                  actually be higher quality. That's what we're
                                  seeing, yeah.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Often higher conversion rates than from other
                                  traffic sources, which is really promising.
                                  Hedges and Company also mentioned needing
                                  custom tracking because standard analytics
                                  weren't quite there yet. And they saw big
                                  jumps in AI traffic after optimizing.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Significant jumps. One case went from almost
                                  nothing to over 300 AI referrals a month. Wow.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  It really shows we need new ways to measure
                                  and understand what's working in this AI
                                  world. Absolutely. Adapt the measurement along
                                  with the strategy.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Okay, let's zoom in a bit on e-commerce. Taku
                                  had some specific advice for optimizing
                                  product content for LLMs. They did.

                                <p>
                                  And a key point was that while optimizing for
                                  chatbots often aligns with optimizing for
                                  human shoppers, the AI needs even more depth
                                  and specificity. More detail. Like what?
                                  Things like using clear conversational
                                  language they suggested around an 8th grade
                                  reading level.

                                  Proactively answering common questions. Maybe
                                  adding detailed FAQs right on the page. Being
                                  super specific about benefits and use cases.

                                  And providing lots of context. Loads of it.
                                  Functionality.

                                  Compatibility. Warranty details. The whole

                                <p>
                                  Basically everything a demanding shopper and
                                  an AI might want to know. Exactly. Use the
                                  keywords customers actually search with.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Provide detailed specs in a structured way.
                                  Include good multimedia. Use metadata and tags
                                  effectively.

                                  And definitely feature those customer reviews
                                  they offer social proof and answer questions
                                  you might not have thought of. It sounds like
                                  the level of detail LLMs need is really just
                                  reflecting what shoppers themselves are
                                  demanding more of anyway. That's a great way
                                  to put it.

                                  The bar is just higher for product information
                                  now. For everyone involved. OK.

                                  Before we wrap up this Conquer AI search
                                  session, let's touch on pitfalls. What common
                                  mistakes are you seeing as brands try to
                                  adapt? And what about AI's own limitations
                                  here? Gravitate Design pointed out a few key
                                  mistakes. One is just blindly trusting
                                  whatever the AI spits out.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Without human review. That's risky. Right.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Need that human oversight. Another is using
                                  really generic one-size-fits-all prompts for
                                  content generation. You need to guide the AI
                                  properly.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  And also, failing to learn and improve, not
                                  looking at the data for AI-generated content
                                  and refining your approach. Makes sense. Treat
                                  it like any other content process.
                                </p>

                                <p>With iteration. Yeah. And AI's limits.</p>

                                <p>
                                  Well, current AI still lacks real emotional
                                  intelligence, you know. It can sometimes
                                  oversimplify complex technical stuff. And its
                                  knowledge is based on the data it was trained
                                  on, so it might lack nuanced real-world
                                  understanding sometimes.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  Which brings us back to needing human experts
                                  involved. Absolutely essential. For review,
                                  for guidance, for adding that layer AI just
                                  can't provide yet.

                                  Okay, so let's try and bring this all
                                  together. The core message from this Conquer
                                  AI Search podcast seems pretty clear.
                                  Generative AI has fundamentally changed the
                                  game for online search.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  No doubt about it. And moving past just
                                  traditional SEO to really embrace GEO and AI
                                  readability optimization. It's not just a
                                  nice-to-have anymore, is it? It feels like a
                                  must-do.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  It really is a necessity now for staying
                                  visible and relevant. But there's opportunity
                                  here too, right? Definitely. For brands that
                                  adapt proactively, there's a real chance to
                                  get ahead.

                                  results, attract better quality traffic,
                                  people actively looking for your specific
                                  info, and connect with customers in new ways.
                                  And potentially see higher conversion rates,
                                  as our AI traffic monitor data is starting to
                                  suggest. Exactly.

                                  There's a tangible upside. So for you, our
                                  listener, as you think about all this, maybe
                                  start looking at your own content. Where are
                                  the opportunities to optimize for AI search?
                                  Can you explore tools like AI Traffic Monitor
                                  to understand this new traffic flow? Yeah,
                                  what are those first steps you can take? How
                                  do you make sure your brand doesn't get left
                                  behind as AI discovery becomes more and more
                                  central? Good questions to ponder.
