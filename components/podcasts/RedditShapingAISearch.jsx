                                      Now, let me share a little backstory about
                                      how we discovered this technique. So, I
                                      was scrolling through Reddit one
                                      day—pretty much my second home these
                                      days—when I carelessly tossed out a tidbit
                                      about AI Monitor to some pals. Fast
                                      forward a couple of months, and I see that
                                      very detail referenced in a completely
                                      unrelated discussion about AI Monitor.
                                    </p>
                                    <p className="mt-3">
                                      That was the moment when my team and I
                                      went, “Hmm, maybe we should try this with
                                      other clients?” And guess what? It worked
                                      like a charm. After a couple of manual
                                      adjustments, it worked better than
                                      anything we knew back then. Slowly, this
                                      technique became our secret sauce for
                                      influencing AI search results. And I kid
                                      you not, we have generated at least $10
                                      million in additional revenue for our
                                      client just because of this technique.
                                    </p>

                                      Later, we conducted our research and
                                      discovered why content on Reddit is
                                      particularly good at influencing AI
                                      search, which was quite a revelation for
                                      us. However, I’m getting ahead of myself.
                                      Let me first explain why you should care
                                      about Reddit, even if you’re not
                                      particularly concerned with Search Engine

                                  what's that? Using Reddit, specifically for
                                  GEO or AEO, answer engine optimization. Yeah,

                                  because the big question, the first one
                                  really, is why? Why does Reddit suddenly
