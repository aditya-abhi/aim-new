                                  Today we're tackling number 10, why entity
                                  optimization isn't just important, but maybe
                                  even more important in the age of AI Search.
                                  Our goal, like always, is to dig into the key
                                  insights, give you the actionable stuff, and
                                  get you up to speed fast on this critical AIO
                                  technique. So let's jump in.
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                  <br />
                                  Okay. So first things first. What exactly is
                                  an entity, you know, in this SEO world? Google
                                  calls it something singular, unique,
                                  well-defined, and distinguishable.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  (1:32 - 1:46)
                                  <br />
                                  But the interesting part is they don't have to
                                  be physical things. We're talking people,
                                  sure, but also places, ideas, brands,
                                  concepts, companies, events, even things like
                                  colors or dates. They're distinct concepts.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  (1:46 - 1:55)
                                  <br />
                                  That's a really key point. Because, you know,
                                  people hear entity and think, isn't that just
                                  a keyword? It's different, right? Totally
                                  different. Keywords are, well, they're the
                                  search terms people type in, the actual words.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  (1:55 - 2:00)
                                  <br />
                                  Like Apple. Exactly. Apple, as a keyword,
                                  could be the fruit, could be the tech company.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  (2:00 - 2:10)
                                  <br />
                                  But as an entity, the context makes it clear.
                                  If you're talking Apple alongside iOS, iPhone,
                                  Tim Cook, well, the AI knows you mean Apple
                                  Inc., the entity. Right.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  (2:11 - 2:22)
                                  <br />
                                  So it's about shifting from just thinking
                                  about strings of words to thinking about the
                                  actual things, the concepts behind them.
                                  Entities are kind of the bigger topics that
                                  keywords fall under. They give the context.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  (2:23 - 2:31)
                                  <br />
                                  Precisely. And look, this isn't some brand new
                                  idea that just popped up. Search engines,
                                  especially Google, have been moving this way
                                  for, well, over a decade now.
