                                  implementing those LLMS.txt files, which are,
                                  like, super important.

                                  crawlers, basically. Exactly. And we've looked
                                  at leveraging Reddit, using authoritative

                                  Which was surprisingly critical, wasn't it? It
                                  really was. So today, we're plunging into the
                                  sixth technique, improving the readability of
                                  your content to really boost your visibility
                                  in generative engine optimization, you know,
                                  sometimes called answer engine optimization,
                                  or AEO. Yeah, and what's really fascinating
                                  here, and this comes straight from our
                                  sources, is how much readability, which, you
                                  know, we always thought was for making human
                                  readers happy, has now become like a
                                  cornerstone for AI search visibility.

                                  <br />
                                  It's kind of a paradox. AI systems, they're
                                  basically trained on human conversation. So
                                  they inherently favor content that's clear,
                                  concise, easy for us to process.

                                  Oh, okay. So it's not just about making your
                                  stuff sound nice, it's about making it super
                                  digestible for those algorithms. The ones
                                  powering AI overviews and those little
                                  generative snippets we see? Exactly those.

                                  Okay, that's a big shift. So let's unpack
                                  this. Why now? For someone maybe deep in
                                  technical SEO, why is basic readability
                                  suddenly more critical? Especially when AI can
                                  supposedly crunch through tons of complex
                                  stuff? Well, it's kind of because of that
                                  processing power, that clarity matters so
                                  much.

                                  Our sources, they really highlight that AI
                                  models prioritize content that just screams
                                  E-E-A-T. Experience, expertise,
                                  authoritativeness, trustworthiness, and
                                  transparency, too. And transparency, yes.

                                  <br />
                                  So readable content, especially if it's backed
                                  up with data, credible sources, that doesn't
                                  just signal credibility to a person reading
                                  it, it makes it crystal clear to the AI. So
                                  the AI picks up on that clarity as a signal.
                                  Absolutely.

                                  The studies we looked at even show that making
                                  content like deeper, but also clearer, can

                                  by up to 40%. 40%? Wow. That's a huge number.

                                  Direct link. Okay, so it's not just about the
                                  words themselves then, is it? We hear
                                  readability and think grammar, sentence
                                  structure. Yeah, good point.

                                  It's definitely more than just the writing.
                                  The sources emphasize things like website
                                  layout, your on-page SEO elements, you know,
                                  the usual suspects there. But also how you
                                  strategically use things like video or
                                  infographics.
                                </p>

                                  Right. Think about it. You could have the most
                                  brilliant writing, just genius-level stuff.
                                </p>

                                  But if it's buried in a messy layout or isn't
                                  optimized, people will just click away. And
                                  now the AI might effectively do the same. And
                                  that flags things like bounce rate.
                                </p>

                                  Exactly. Bounce rates go up, search engines
                                  and AI see that as a negative signal. Poor
                                  user experience.

                                  Right. So it's holistic. We need the whole
                                  package.
                                </p>

                                  Okay, so if we want our content easily
                                  understood by both humans and AI, where do we
                                  start with the writing itself? What's
                                  principle number one? Simplicity. That's the
                                  word our sources keep hitting. You really have
                                  to avoid jargon, those overly complex words.
                                </p>

                                  But what if the topic is complex? You
                                  sometimes need the technical terms. Totally.
                                  And that's okay.
                                </p>

                                  If you have to use a big word, the rule is
                                  define it immediately, like right after you
                                  use it. And define it in super simple
                                  language. Gotcha.
                                </p>

                                  Like explaining it to someone outside the
                                  field. Exactly. Think of it like that.
                                </p>

                                  You want the information delivered efficiently
                                  without forcing the AI or the reader to do
                                  heavy lifting just to understand the words.
                                  Makes perfect sense. So keep it simple.
                                </p>

                                  What about structuring sentences and
                                  paragraphs? Any like hard rules there? Yeah,
                                  this is where it gets really practical and it
                                  taps into psychology and processing. Write
                                  short sentences. That's a big one.
                                </p>

                                  How short is short? Well, the general
                                  guideline is anything over, say, 20 words
                                  starts to feel long. Shorter sentences are
                                  just easier to scan, easier to understand,
                                  less chance of getting lost. Yes.

                                  And related to that, keep paragraphs short
                                  too. Ah, okay. Like how short? Aim for maybe
                                  100 words or less.

                                  And crucially, stick to just one main idea per
                                  paragraph. One idea. Okay.
                                </p>

                                  Yeah. This creates white space, breathing room
                                  on the page. Yeah.
                                </p>

                                  text are the worst on mobile.

                                  can see that.

                                  Less cognitive load. Which brings me to active

                                  Stick with active voice whenever you can. Why
                                  exactly? It just delivers a clearer message.
                                  It's more direct.

                                  The subject does the action. You know, the

                                  Right. But passive construction is just
                                  wordier, a bit more distant.

                                  Now passive voice isn't evil. It has its uses,
                                  like in formal science papers or if you don't
                                  know who did the action. But generally, active
                                  voice is more engaging, more dynamic, more
                                  like how people actually talk.

                                  beyond just the text? Right. The visual and
                                  logical flow. Subheadings are your best friend
                                  here.

                                  They make a huge difference. They break up the
                                  text, let readers and AI scan quickly, find
                                  what they need, digest info in related chunks.

                                  How should we structure them? Like H1, H2, H3.
                                  Yeah, exactly. Think of your H1 as the main
                                  title, the book title.

                                  H2s are your main sections, like chapters. And
                                  H3s are for subsections within those chapters,
                                  drilling down a bit. Got it.

                                  Any guideline on how much text should follow a
                                  subheading? Good question. Ideally, keep it
                                  manageable. Maybe around 250 to 350 words.

                                  You just want to avoid those long, unbroken
                                  walls of text that make people's eyes glaze
                                  over. Right. And what about lists? Bullet
                                  points, numbered lists? Definitely use them.

                                  Our sources really push these. They break
                                  things up visually, again, helping readers
                                  rest their eyes and pinpoint info fast. And
                                  for the AI? They're great for AI, too.

                                  Makes it much easier for them to pull out key
                                  points for summaries or answers. They're like
                                  little structured data points within your

                                  Okay. Lists and headings. What about actual
                                  visuals, images, videos? And you mentioned
                                  empty space earlier.

                                  Yeah, visuals are key. Simple images can be
                                  really powerful. They can convey an idea
                                  quickly, reduce the mental effort needed from
                                  the reader.

                                  And things like images, videos, infographics,
                                  they cater to different learning styles.
                                  Visual auditory learners, wider reach. And how
                                  does AI interact with video, for instance?
                                  Well, if your videos are optimized, good
                                  titles, descriptions, tags with relevant
                                  keywords, and importantly, transcripts.

                                  <br />
                                  Transcripts. Yes. Transcripts allow the AI to
                                  effectively read the video content.
                                </p>

                                  accessible to the AI. Okay. So optimize
                                  everything.

                                  Now, about that white space. Sounds like
                                  nothing. Why is nothing important? Yeah.
                                </p>

                                  It sounds weird, doesn't it? But white space,
                                  or negative space, is just the intentional
                                  empty area around things. It doesn't have to
                                  be white, just empty. No text.
                                </p>

                                  No images. Okay. And its purpose.
                                </p>

                                <p>

                                  Its purpose is huge. It gives the eye
                                  breathing room, stops the page feeling
                                  cluttered or overwhelming. It helps the
                                  important stuff, your text, your key images
                                  really stand out.
                                </p>

                                  It improves focus. Exactly. Improves focus,
                                  improves legibility, reduces that cognitive
                                  load we talked about.

                                  Yeah. Makes the whole thing look cleaner, more
                                  professional. I was thinking examples.

                                  Think about Apple's website, or Google's
                                  homepage, or Medium articles. They use white
                                  space brilliantly. It guides your attention,
                                  conveys simplicity and clarity.

                                  And AI interprets a clean, user-friendly
                                  design as a sign of quality. Fascinating.
                                  Okay.

                                  So we've got language, sentence structure,
                                  page structure, visuals, even empty space.
                                  What else contributes to making content
                                  appealing to both readers and AI? Credibility.
                                  This came up again and again in the sources.

                                  your EEAT standing with generative AI. How so?
                                  Well, think about it. AI models can't just
                                  invent facts or stats.

                                  So content that provides data and shows its

                                  makes your content much more likely to be
                                  trusted, referenced, highlighted in AI

                                  Our sources mentioned a potential boost from
                                  citations alone, didn't they? They did, yeah.
                                  Something like a 30-40% increase in AI
                                  visibility just by adding robust citations. It
                                  signals you've done your homework.

                                  One more thing that popped out from the
                                  sources. Storytelling. How does telling
                                  stories fit into optimizing for AI? Seems
                                  counterintuitive for logical machines.
                                </p>

                                  It does seem that way, but it's actually a
                                  really smart strategy. The sources call it a
                                  superpower. Humans are just wired for stories,
                                  right? They grab us, help us connect, help us
                                  remember, they add emotion.

                                  And while AI seems purely logical, remember
                                  what it's trained on. Human conversation.
                                  Billions of examples of human conversation,
                                  which is packed with stories, anecdotes,
                                  experiences.

                                  Ah, okay. So AI recognizes narrative
                                  structure. It understands the patterns and the
                                  engagement factor.

                                  Stories, even little ones, make content
                                  memorable, more engaging, less dry. You can
                                  use them in intros to hook people, use case
                                  studies to illustrate points, share your own
                                  journey. Client transformations, maybe?

                                  Or even talking about failures and what you

                                  improving readability.

                                  It's not just about dumbing things down, not
                                  at all. It's about being strategic, crafting

                                  conversational, more discerning, with
