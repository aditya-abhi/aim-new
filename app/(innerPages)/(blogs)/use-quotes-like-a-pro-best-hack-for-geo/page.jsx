          text: "Great question! While original content is key, quotes act like trust badges for AI systems. Generative engines prioritize content backed by credible voices (like experts or recent studies) because they’re trained to value authority. Quotes signal, “Hey, this isn’t just my opinion—it’s validated by pros!” No quotes? Your content might get flagged as “thin” or unsubstantiated by AI.",

          text: "SEO is about ranking higher on search engine results pages (SERPs). GEO is about optimizing for the AI tools that generate those answers (like chatbots or AI Overviews). SEO cares about keywords and backlinks; GEO cares about authority, freshness, and how easily AI can “quote” your content. Think of it as SEO for the robot answer factories.",

          text: "Nope—AI tools sniff out credibility like bloodhounds. Pulling quotes from random social media rants or unvetted sources won’t cut it. Instead, stick to industry leaders (e.g., “According to Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google…”), peer-reviewed studies or recent reports (e.g., “A 2024 Harvard study found…”), and recognized publications like Forbes or MIT Tech Review.",

Older quotes from timeless experts (like Einstein or Brené Brown) can still work. But always ask: Does this quote feel relevant today? If not, swap it for a 2024 take.",
