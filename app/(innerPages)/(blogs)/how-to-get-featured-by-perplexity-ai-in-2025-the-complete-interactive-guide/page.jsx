For deeper insights, run manual queries in Perplexity to see how your content is being surfaced and interpreted.

It often includes original research, relevant statistics, or expert commentary to establish authority and trust. Sources from well-maintained websites or communities like Reddit, Quora, and Wikipedia tend to be favored for their credibility and user engagement. Long-form, reference-style content that’s genuinely helpful and comprehensive consistently ranks higher and earns more citations across AI platforms.",

Google AI Overviews focus on authority, citing high-DR sites like Forbes and Mayo Clinic, but are less transparent.
